# PACMAN
 Pacman game made with Unity
This project is a complete Pacman game. The map is made by reading a .csv file and positioning each asset depending on the code in the file. The ghosts IA are just like the original ones. Also, the game contains a system to save the max scores into a .txt file and show them inside the game.
